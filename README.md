# Deepkit Bookstore Example

Little example to demonstrate Deepkit API Console.

This application is deployed at https://deepkit-bookstore.herokuapp.com/api. It uses Heroku Free Dynos,
so it might be a bit slow and takes a while on first request.

### Install

```
npm i
npm run start
```


Then open https://127.0.0.1/api
